# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to `ensis-ui`. This page covers how to develop, document, and land changes in this repository.

Also read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

中文：[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). PR descriptions may be Chinese or English.

Do **not** put publish tokens or personal npm accounts in user-facing docs (README, consumers). Release secrets stay on this page.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:site     # docs site (public usage): http://127.0.0.1:5181
pnpm dev          # internal test bench: http://127.0.0.1:5180 (not usage docs)
pnpm build        # library → dist/
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
```

Requires Node.js ≥ 20, pnpm ≥ 9 in this repo, Vue ^3.5. Downstream installs may use npm, pnpm, or yarn.

## Pull requests

1. Open an Issue first for large features or breaking API changes.
2. Keep each PR focused.
3. Add or update `*.spec.ts` under the module’s `__tests__/` when behavior changes (components: `src/components/{slug}/__tests__/`; cross-component smoke only in `src/__tests__/`).
4. Public usage **must** land on the docs site `site/` (catalog + `demos/{slug}.vue`). How to write it: [site/README.en.md](./site/README.en.md). `playground/` is internal smoke / visual regression only and must not be treated as usage docs.
5. When public API, tokens, architecture, or install steps change, update:
   - [docs/components.md](./docs/components.md) and [docs/components.en.md](./docs/components.en.md)
   - [docs/consumers.md](./docs/consumers.md) / [docs/consumers.en.md](./docs/consumers.en.md)
   - [README.md](./README.md) / [README.zh-CN.md](./README.zh-CN.md) if install rules change
   - the `[Unreleased]` section of [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
6. Do not bump `package.json` `version` except in a release PR.

### Commit messages

Prefer a short imperative sentence (Chinese or English):

- `feat: add collapse mode to RsXxx`
- `fix: keep RsTable selection after filter`
- `docs: document Tree fieldNames`
- `chore: tighten CI`

Use your own git identity. Do not commit as Cursor or another bot account.

## Release

1. Move `[Unreleased]` notes in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) under `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`. Prereleases use a hyphenated version such as `X.Y.Z-beta.1`.
2. Set `package.json` `version` to that same number.
3. Merge to `main`. **Release** reads the first `## [x.y.z]` in the changelog. It fails when that number differs from `package.json`, and it stops when `vX.Y.Z` already exists. For a new version it runs `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`, then creates an annotated tag (message `ensis-ui X.Y.Z` plus that changelog section, visible in `git show vX.Y.Z`) and pushes it.
4. That tag push uses the Actions token, so it does not start other workflows. Release then starts **Publish** with `workflow_dispatch`: tests, `prepublishOnly` build of `dist/`, `pnpm publish`, and a **GitHub Release** from that CHANGELOG section. **Deploy Docs** publishes the docs site for the same commit when `main` is pushed. Stable versions use the npm dist-tag `latest`; hyphenated prereleases use `next`.
5. When the tag is already on the remote but npm or the Release notes are missing: Actions → Publish → **Run workflow**, set `tag` (for example `v1.1.1`). Check `skip_npm` when only the notes need filling in.

Pushing `vX.Y.Z` from a local checkout starts Publish directly.

The repository needs a Secret named `NPM_TOKEN`.

Create it so CI does not fail with `EOTP`:

1. npm → Access Tokens → **Granular Access Token**
2. Package `ensis-ui`: **Read and write**
3. Enable **Bypass two-factor authentication**
4. Store the token as GitHub Actions Secret `NPM_TOKEN`

Do not store a one-time OTP as the Secret.

## Component rules

The full architecture contract (red lines, public surface, tokens, Vue/CSS/overlay/form/a11y/SSR, checklist):

- English: [docs/components.en.md](./docs/components.en.md)
- 中文: [docs/components.md](./docs/components.md)

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Naming | Public components `Rs*`; internal `*-utils.ts` has no `Rs` prefix |
| Public API | Export only from `src/index.ts`; DOM internals stay private |
| Reka UI | Primitives stay inside this package; hosts and the site must not import `reka-ui` |
| Tokens | `--rs-*` only; no hardcoded brand colors, px, or system font stacks |
| Size / radius | `RsComponentSize` / `RsRadius` + resolve hooks |
| Shape × color | `variant` is shape, `tone` is hue |
| i18n | `useRsI18n`; omitted locale follows the host language, fallback `zh-CN`; pair zh-CN / en-US. Community packs: [docs/locales.en.md](./docs/locales.en.md) |
| External specs | WHATWG semantics, Vue Style Guide A/B, APG keyboard; Google HTML/CSS is not a contract |
| A11y | Native first, then ARIA; icon buttons need a label; current item `aria-current`; overlay focus trap |
| Docs | Public usage is `site/` only; `playground/` is internal test |
| Tests | Mount smoke + utils edge cases |
| Directories | Component: `index.ts` + `src/` + `__tests__/`. Keep `src/` flat; only engine-sized folders nest. See [§3](./docs/components.en.md) |

### Adding a component

Follow the checklist in [docs/components.en.md §15](./docs/components.en.md). Folder template:

```text
src/components/{slug}/
  index.ts              # export { default as RsXxx } from './src/RsXxx.vue'
  src/
    RsXxx.vue
    xxx-utils.ts        # when needed
  style/                # only when there is standalone CSS
  __tests__/
    RsXxx.spec.ts
```

Add one line to `src/index.ts`: `export { RsXxx } from './components/{slug}'`. Folder name equals the docs slug. Register the group in `site/catalog/components/{group}.ts` (`basic` / `form` / `nav` / `feedback` / `data` / `editor`). Do not nest source folders by group. Then locale → **site catalog + demo** → inventory → CHANGELOG. Playground is optional.

## Community locales

Official tables stay zh-CN / en-US. Registration, key lists, and plurals: [docs/locales.en.md](./docs/locales.en.md). Do not add official ja / ar / ko tables to `messages.ts`.

### Breaking changes

Props / events / slots / exports / tokens / default-value semantics need a **MAJOR** and a CHANGELOG migration note. An unlisted new export is an architecture break.
